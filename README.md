## Progress in Branches

### Branch: `data-cleaning`
- Initialised R environment with required libraries.
- Loaded six datasets from CSV files into RStudio.
- Standardised each dataset to ensure consistent column naming and retained only relevant fields for analysis.
- Transformed and cleaned columns, including:
  - Converted date columns to consistent formats (`Date` or `POSIXct`).
  - Replaced invalid `ZIP` values (`00000`) with `NA`.
  - Converted long numeric codes (e.g., `procedure_code`, `diagnosis_code`) to character format.
- Combined datasets into a single `combined_data` dataset for further analysis.
- Conducted data quality checks, including:
  - Validating relationships between patients, encounters, and other entities.
  - Inspecting for missing values, inconsistencies, and duplicates.

### Branch: `data-analysis`
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
  - Conducted an initial exploration of the dataset to understand its characteristics:
    - Analysed the distribution of patients by `age_group`, `gender`, and `diagnosis_description`.
    - Identified the most frequent `diagnoses` and `medications`.
    - Investigated trends in medical procedures over time.
    - Explored relationships between patient demographics (e.g., `age_group`, `gender`) and diagnosis/medication types.
  - Generated tables and graphs to summarise key insights:
    - Patient distribution by age groups, gender, and diagnosis.
    - Diagnosis and medication frequencies by demographics.
    - Trends in medical procedures over recent years.

- **Statistical Analysis**:
  - Performed basic statistical summaries:
    - Calculated mean, median, and standard deviation for numerical columns such as `age`, `length_of_stay`, and `total_visits`.
    - Summarised patient visits, diagnoses, and medications for insights into common patterns.
  - Identified outliers and potential skewed distributions:
    - Created boxplots for variables such as `age`, `length_of_stay`, and `total_visits` to visually detect anomalies.
    - Applied log transformations where necessary to better represent skewed data (e.g., `length_of_stay`, `total_visits`).

## Detailed steps taken for each Branch

### Branch: `data-cleaning`

#### Transformed Datasets
1. **patients_transformed**:
   - Retained: `patient_id`, `birthdate`, `age`, `gender`, `city`, `zip`, `income`.
   - Transformed:
     - Calculated `age` from `birthdate`.
     - Converted `ZIP` to replace `00000` with `NA`.

2. **conditions_transformed**:
   - Retained: `diagnosis_start`, `diagnosis_stop`, `patient_id`, `encounter_id`, `diagnosis_code`, `diagnosis_description`.
   - Transformed:
     - Converted `diagnosis_start` and `diagnosis_stop` to `Date`.
     - Converted `diagnosis_code` to `character`.

3. **medications_transformed**:
   - Retained: `medication_start`, `medication_stop`, `patient_id`, `encounter_id`, `medication_code`, `medication_name`.
   - Transformed:
     - Converted `medication_start` and `medication_stop` to `POSIXct`.
     - Converted `medication_code` to `character`.

4. **procedures_transformed**:
   - Retained: `procedure_start`, `procedure_stop`, `patient_id`, `encounter_id`, `procedure_code`, `procedure_description`.
   - Transformed:
     - Converted `procedure_start` and `procedure_stop` to `POSIXct`.
     - Converted `procedure_code` to `character`.

5. **organizations_transformed**:
   - Retained: `hospital_id`, `hospital_name`.

6. **encounters_transformed**:
   - Retained: `encounter_id`, `encounter_start`, `encounter_stop`, `patient_id`, `hospital_id`, `encounter_code`, `encounter_description`.
   - Transformed:
     - Converted `encounter_start` and `encounter_stop` to `POSIXct`.

---

#### Combined Dataset: `combined_data`
- **Joined Tables**:
   - Used `patient_id` to join `patients_transformed` with `encounters_transformed`.
   - Then used `encounter_id` to join `encounters_transformed` with:
     - `conditions_transformed`
     - `medications_transformed`
     - `procedures_transformed`.
   - Lastly, used `hospital_id` to join `encounters_transformed` with `organizations_transformed`.

- **Standardised Columns**:
   - Converted date columns to consistent formats:
     - **Date Format (`YYYY-MM-DD`)**: Applied to columns like `birthdate`, `diagnosis_start`, and `diagnosis_stop`.
     - **Datetime Format (`YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS`)**: Applied to columns like `encounter_start`, `encounter_stop`, `medication_start`, `medication_stop`, `procedure_start`, and `procedure_stop`.
   - Replaced invalid `ZIP` values (`00000`) with `NA` to better handle missing or placeholder data.
   - Converted long numeric codes (`diagnosis_code`, `procedure_code`, `medication_code`) to `character` format to prevent issues with scientific notation (e.g., `4.56191E+14`).
   - Converted numeric columns (`age`, `income`) to ensure proper data types for analysis.
   
- **Exported Dataset**:
   - Saved the joined dataset `combined_data` to `combined_data.csv` for further analysis.

---

#### Data Quality Checks
1. **Basic Structure Validation**:
   - Confirmed the dataset dimensions to ensure the number of rows and columns match expectations.
   - Validated column names to confirm they are correctly standardised.

2. **Missing Values**:
   - Calculated the count and percentage of missing values for all columns.
   - Presented results in a readable long-format table, sorted by the highest missing values.

3. **Relationship Validation**:
   - Verified that each `encounter_id` is tied to a single `patient_id`.
   - Checked that all `patient_id` values are linked to encounters.

4. **Uniqueness and Duplicates**:
   - Counted distinct values for key columns (`patient_id`, `encounter_id`, etc.).
   - Identified duplicate rows by comparing total rows with unique rows.

5. **Encounter Linkage**:
   - Aggregated the number of related records (`diagnosis_code`, `procedure_code`, `medication_code`) for each `encounter_id`.
   - Counted non-missing values for these columns to get an overview of their distribution across encounters.

## Branch: `data-analysis`

### Overview
- Developed `data_analysis.R` to perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) and generate insights from the cleaned `combined_data.csv` dataset.
- Focused on understanding patient demographics, temporal trends, and diagnosis/procedure frequencies.
- Created new variables, aggregated data, and visualised insights to identify patterns.

---

### New Variables
1. **`age_group`**:
   - Categorised patients into broad age groups (`0-17`, `18-34`, `35-64`, and `65+`) to ensure sufficient records for meaningful analysis.

2. **`age_group_code`**:
   - Assigned numeric codes to age groups for easier sorting and statistical operations.

3. **`length_of_stay`**:
   - Calculated the number of days between `encounter_start` and `encounter_stop` for each hospital visit.

---

### Aggregated Data
1. **Visits Per Patient**:
   - Summarised the total number of unique hospital visits for each patient.

2. **Diagnosis Frequency**:
   - Aggregated the frequency of each `diagnosis_description` and its corresponding `diagnosis_code`.

3. **Medications By Age Group**:
   - Counted the number of medications prescribed within each age group.

4. **Procedures Per Hospital**:
   - Calculated the total number of procedures performed per hospital.
